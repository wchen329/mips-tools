# MIPS-Tools
MIPS-Tools is a collection of tools that may be useful in the aid of computer architecture study, particularly for the MIPS architecture. It is intended to be fully functional on both Windows and UNIX-like systems upon its completion.

## Milestone 1
This specific branch is a snapshot of the last version of Milestone 1. It is here for historic purposes (in case something from M1 needs to brought back again in later releases). It is not intended for actual use and will not be maintained going forward.

## Build Instructions
### Windows
Within the MIPS Tools directory there is a Visual Studio solution. This Visual Studio solution is for VS2010 and it should be able to be opened in any Visual Studio that is newer that 2010 as well. From there it is as simple to run "Build" and the project should build.

### UNIX and UNIX-like
This last snapshot of Milestone 1 actually ended up being broken on Unix systems (at least with GCC). In order to build it, there are (relatively) a lot of compiler errors that need to be fixed (to be fixed in M2).
