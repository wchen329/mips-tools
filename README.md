# MIPS-Tools
MIPS-Tools is a collection of tools that may be useful in the aid of computer architecture study, particularly for the MIPS architecture. 

## Features
The following is a list of planned features for the simulator:
* Basic architecture support for simulating a CPU and a single memory system
* MIPS raw assembler (with no executable formatting)
* Latency and cycle verbosity support
* Default single cycle CPU and five stage pipeline support
* SMT emulation support
* R10k processor simulation support
* Custom processor and ISA (x86?) support through dynamic linking
