# MIPS-Tools
MIPS-Tools is a collection of tools that may be useful in the aid of computer architecture study, particularly for the MIPS architecture. It is intended to be fully functional on both Windows and UNIX-like systems upon its completion.

## Build Instructions
### Windows
Within the MIPS Tools directory there is a Visual Studio solution. This Visual Studio solution is for VS2010 and it should be able to be opened in any Visual Studio that is newer that 2010 as well. From there it is as simple to run "Build" and the project should build.

### UNIX and UNIX-like
UNIX compiling can be done currently by utilizing the csh build file provided. A standard UNIX/GNU Makefile is soon to arive though! Currently confirmed working for FreeBSD.
